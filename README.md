# MT-Game-Engine
The MT Game Engine is a library containing wrapper classes for much of OpenGL functionality in addition to game creation utilities, including:
* Pre-managed shaders and buffer configuration
* Texture loading and application
* 2D and 3D shape rendering, transformation, and collision
* A controllable camera, with free-form and first-person camera modes
* Chunk-based rendering for improved performance

The library also wraps GLFW functionality for portable input handling and OpenGL context creation.
